name: Weekly College Football Predictions

on:
  # Run every Tuesday at 9 AM UTC
  # Tuesday is ideal because:
  # - Most games are on Saturday
  # - Previous week's games are complete by Tuesday
  # - Gives time to prepare predictions for upcoming week
  # To change: cron format is 'minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week'
  # Examples: '0 9 * * 1' = Monday 9 AM, '0 14 * * 3' = Wednesday 2 PM
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * 2"

  # Allow manual trigger for testing
